    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise, and then thinly slice crosswise slightly diagonally. If the cucumbers are thin, you can simply cut into thin rounds. </li>

        <li>Tightly squeeze out the water content from the salted cucumber slices.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Quickly stir in the garlic. Add the cucumbers. Stir-fry for a minute until the cucumbers are slightly cooked. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat. Toss well with the sesame oil, and sesame seeds. </li>
